# incubator-pekko-site

## Status

This repo is a temporary solution to publishing the Apache Pekko website. The artifacts
are built in the Pekko modules. A Pekko committer can use the commands below to
copy these artifacts and commit them.

Anyone looking to help improve our docs should look at the Git repos
(eg [incubator-pekko](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pekko)) for the modules.
Typically, `sbt docs/paradoxBrowse` will build the docs and load them into your browser
when they are ready.
