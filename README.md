# incubator-pekko-site

## Status

This repo is used to publish the home page of the [Apache Pekko website](https://pekko.apache.org). 

Anyone looking to help improve our module specific docs should look at the Git repos
(eg [incubator-pekko](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pekko)) for the modules.
Typically, `sbt docs/paradoxBrowse` will build the docs and load them into your browser
when they are ready. These repos have GitHub Action CI jobs that deploy the docs associated with
those repos on a nightly basis.

There are some details about how to deploy the pages associated with this repo in the
[wiki](https://github.com/apache/incubator-pekko-site/wiki/Manual-Publishing).
