# Download

This page is a placeholder. When we release Pekko 1.0.0, this page will include links for downloading
the official Source Release. It will also provide instructions on how to verify the downloaded files.

We will also publish jars to Maven Central and we expect that most users will use those for convenience.

We already publish snapshot jars to https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots/org/apache/pekko/.
